        <h2>About The Movie</h2>
        <p>the Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film
            written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is
            the first installment in The Matrix film series,
            starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss,
            Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian
            future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a
            simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines
            have created to distract humans while using their bodies as
            an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson,
            under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he joins
            a rebellion against the machines along with other people who
            have been freed from the Matrix.</p>
