        <h2>About The Movie</h2>
        <p>the Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film
            written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is
            the first installment in The Matrix film series,
            starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss,
            Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian
            future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a
            simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines
            have created to distract humans while using their bodies as
            an energy source.[7] When computer programmer Thomas Anderson,
            under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he joins
            a rebellion against the machines along with other people who
            have been freed from the Matrix.</p>
